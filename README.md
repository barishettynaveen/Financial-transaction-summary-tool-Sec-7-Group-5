# STEP 1 — TEAM FORMATION & LIFTOFF

Mission & Vision :
Our mission is to build a Python-based Financial Transactions Summary Tool that helps summarize and analyze financial data efficiently.
Our vision is to create reusable, modular Python functions that can later be integrated into a financial dashboard or visualization tool.

Success Priorities:
Deliver a functional, modular, and well-documented Python codebase.

Demonstrate consistent Agile collaboration through GitHub and Taiga.

Ensure even contribution and communication across all members.

Complete all sprint stories within one week.

Working Agreements:
Daily check-in message on group chat (e.g., Discord, WhatsApp).

Use GitHub branches per feature; no direct commits to main.

All code must go through a Pull Request (PR) and at least one peer review.

Commit messages must reference story IDs.

No last-day rush — commits spread over the week.

Team Definition of Done:
Code runs without errors.

Follows PEP8 style and includes docstrings.

Reviewed and approved via PR.

Linked to a completed user story on Taiga.

Tests pass successful
