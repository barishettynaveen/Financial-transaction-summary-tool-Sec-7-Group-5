### US-01 Implementation

This user story involved building the core data-loading step for the project. The team implemented the load_and_clean_data() function, which reads the raw CSV file, removes missing or invalid records, standardizes data types, and prepares a clean dataset for all other summaries and visualizations. This ensures that every feature in the tool is based on accurate and reliable data.
