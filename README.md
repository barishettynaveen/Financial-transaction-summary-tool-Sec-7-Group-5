# Financial-transaction-summary-tool

# 📘 Project Purpose & Sprint Goal
This project aims to develop a **Python-based Financial Transactions Summary Tool** that reads, cleans, and summarizes a dataset of financial transactions.  
It provides key insights such as income vs. expenses, monthly spending trends, and top spending categories.  

**Sprint Goal:**  
Deliver a working Python tool within one Agile sprint that processes a financial transactions dataset and outputs meaningful summaries and insights.

# STEP 1 — TEAM FORMATION & LIFTOFF

#Mission & Vision :

Our mission is to build a Python-based Financial Transactions Summary Tool that helps summarize and analyze financial data efficiently.
Our vision is to create reusable, modular Python functions that can later be integrated into a financial dashboard or visualization tool.

#Success Priorities:

Deliver a functional, modular, and well-documented Python codebase.

Demonstrate consistent Agile collaboration through GitHub and Taiga.

Ensure even contribution and communication across all members.

Complete all sprint stories within one week.

#Working Agreements:

Daily check-in message on group chat (e.g., Discord, WhatsApp).

Use GitHub branches per feature; no direct commits to main.

All code must go through a Pull Request (PR) and at least one peer review.

Commit messages must reference story IDs.

No last-day rush — commits spread over the week.

#Team Definition of Done:

Code runs without errors.

Follows PEP8 style and includes docstrings.

Reviewed and approved via PR.

Linked to a completed user story on Taiga.

Tests pass successful
